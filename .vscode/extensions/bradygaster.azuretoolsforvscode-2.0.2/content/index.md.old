# Azure Tools for Visual Studio Code v 2.0.0
---

V2 of the Azure Tools removes Azure App Service, Azure Functions, and Azure Storage features, as those features are better represented in official extensions that provide great support for these service areas. 

To mitigate the loss of features that have been deprecated from this extension in V2, we've taken a dependency on the official extensions that support the features previously provided by this extension. 

* [Azure App Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice)
* [Azure Functions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)
* [Azure Storage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestorage)
